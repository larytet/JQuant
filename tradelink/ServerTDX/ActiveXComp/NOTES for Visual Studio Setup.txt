I am not sure how transportable this will be, I had some issues checking it out on a differnt computer.
If there is an issue, its an easy fix.

1) Go to the ActiveX directory and run the .cmd file to register the dll on the current system.
2) add the com reference in Visual studio project
3) In the form code where the api object is defined comment it out. This will give an error
4) Go to form design view, right click on toolbox and add choose items
5) Add the TDAPIICom object (this should place an ameritrade logo on your form)
6) change the name of the object to api.

Code should build now.
